## Learning Objectives

## Lecture

Class meets 1 time a week in person.  Typically class will comprise a lecture with some in-class assignments sprinkled throughout.  These are due the **next day by 11:59pm**.  Ensure you keep up on these, as they factor into the Participation part of your grade.  

**Note**: I will not accept late in-class assignment submissions - no exceptions.

## Term Project

There will be a half-semester term project.  Check out the [term projects page](term-projects) for more details.

## Assignments

All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date they are due.  Please check Blackboard regularly for upcoming due dates.  If you are struggling or are having problems, please contact me in advance.  If you message me or email me the night something is due I will most likely not accept your reasoning.  If you get in touch early then we can work it out.

* Individual and team assignment late penalty: 10% per day (including weekends)
* Late in-class assignment submissions are **not accepted**
