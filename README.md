## Course Description

This course introduces students to mobile, ubiquitous, pervasive, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) computing systems and services. Students will develop design skills for pervasive software development using different device platforms. It also provides an overview of future trends and ongoing research in these fast-growing areas.

## Learning Objectives

After successful completion of the course, the students will be able to:

1. Analysis/Identify: Identify aspects of mobile, ubiquitous and pervasive computing systems.
2. Analysis/Analyze: Analyze the current problems in pervasive systems and the need for using the IoT as a solution vehicle.
3. Adaptation/Develop: Develop research skills to stay current with the rapidly changing nature of data acquisition and technologies in the IoT sensor based systems.
4. Adaptation/Build: Build Internet of Things (IoT) solutions.
5. Application/Apply: Apply defensive security techniques to protect IoT infrastructure

## Lecture

Class meets 1 time a week in person.  Typically class will comprise a lecture, discussion, and a lab.  Please ensure you bring your hardware kit (Circuit Playground + connectors) to each class. 

---

## Term Project

There will be a half-semester term project.  Check out the [term projects page](term-projects) for more details.

---

## Assignments

All assignments are due by 11:59pm on the date they are due.  Please check Blackboard regularly for upcoming due dates.  If you are struggling or are having problems, please contact me in advance.  If you message me or email me the night something is due I will most likely not accept your reasoning.  If you get in touch early then we can work it out.

* Individual and team assignment late penalty: 10% per day (including weekends)

### Submissions

* All course content is hosted on this page.
* **All assignment submissions are to be submitted via [Blackboard](https://lms.gvsu.edu){:target="\_blank"}!**

## Hardware Kit

The hardware kit available in the GVSU Laker store is **required**.  It should comprise:

* Circuit Playground Bluefruit - Bluetooth Low Energy: [https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4333){:target="\_blank"}
* MicroUSB to USB cable with data line (data line required otherwise the device can't be programmed): [https://www.adafruit.com/product/592](https://www.adafruit.com/product/592){:target="\_blank"}
* Set of alligator clip leads (12): [https://www.adafruit.com/product/1008](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1008){:target="\_blank"}

Labs and homework assignments will be focused around the Circuit Playground and we will be using them in the first class - ensure you're prepared for day 1!
